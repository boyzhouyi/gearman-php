gearman-php
===========

*gearman-php* is a convenience wrapper for the [Gearman](http://gearman.org) 
[PEAR Library](http://pear.php.net/package/Net_Gearman/).

With gearman-php, you can code workers as well as clients in PHP with minimal
overhead in your application. Server connections etc. all take place in
gearman-php and don't unnecessarily clog your application code.
